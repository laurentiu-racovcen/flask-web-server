# Homework 1

## Explanation of the chosen solution

* The chosen solution implements a Flask-based web server that exposes an API for performing various analyses on health-related data. The `__init__.py` file initializes the Flask application (`webserver`), configures logging, and sets up a thread pool (`ThreadPool`) from `app.task_runner.py` to handle incoming requests concurrently. The `DataIngestor` class in `data_ingestor.py` is responsible for reading and providing access to the data from a CSV file. API endpoints are defined in `routes.py`, which receive requests, enqueue jobs for the thread pool, and return results or job statuses. The actual data analysis logic is implemented in the functions within `thread_utils.py`. Each request triggers a job that is placed in the `ThreadPool`'s queue. Worker threads (`TaskRunner`) pick up these jobs, execute the corresponding analysis function, and store the results as JSON files in the `results` directory. The general approach is to separate the web server logic (handling requests and responses) from the data processing logic (data ingestion and analysis) using a thread pool for concurrency.

    ```python
    # Example from "__init__.py" showing Flask app and ThreadPool initialization
    from flask import Flask
    from app.task_runner import ThreadPool

    webserver = Flask(__name__)
    webserver.tasks_runner = ThreadPool()
    webserver.tasks_runner.start()
    ```

    ```python
    # Example from "data_ingestor.py" showing data loading
    import pandas

    class DataIngestor:
        def __init__(self, csv_path: str):
            self.__csv_file = pandas.read_csv(csv_path)
    ```

    ```python
    # Example from "routes.py" showing API endpoint definition
    from flask import request, jsonify
    from app import webserver

    @webserver.route('/api/states_mean', methods=['POST'])
    def states_mean_request():
        if not "question" in request.json:
            return missing_question_message("states_mean")
        return process_post_request("states_mean", request.json)
    ```

    ```python
    # Example from "task_runner.py" showing job execution
    class TaskRunner(Thread):
        # ...
        def execute_job(self, job):
            endpoint = job['endpoint']
            if endpoint in ThreadUtils.endpoint_func_map:
                return self.get_job_output(ThreadUtils.endpoint_func_map[endpoint], job)
            return {
                "status": "error",
                "reason": "No such endpoint"
            }
    ```

    ```python
    # Example from "thread_utils.py" showing a data analysis function
    def states_mean(question, entries):
        # ... logic to calculate the mean for each state ...
        return dict(sorted(results_dict.items(), key = lambda item : item[1]))
    ```

* **Do you find the homework useful?**

Yes, I've gotten hands-on practice with building a web server using Flask. Understanding how to design and implement the different API endpoints and connect them to the data analysis functions has really improved my understanding of backend development.

* **Do you find the implementation naive, effective, could have been better?**

I find the implementation reasonably effective for handling a moderate number of concurrent requests. The current implementation uses file-based storage for results, which is simple but might become inefficient for a large number of jobs. A more robust solution could involve using a database.

***Special case:***

* The implementation handles cases where required parameters (like 'question' or 'state') are missing in the request JSON, returning appropriate error messages.
* Exceptions handling.

Implementation
-

* **Specify whether the entire homework statement is implemented:**

Yes, the entire homework statement is implemented.

* **Interesting things discovered along the way:**

    - How quickly and easily web APIs can be built using the Flask framework in Python.
    - The role of logging in a server application.
    - The clear separation of concerns between the web server, task management, data ingestion, and data analysis logic. This modular design makes the codebase more organized and easier to maintain.
